# titanic-data-analysis
This is a project developed by Mineros DataLab aiming to (1) explore the original database, (2) clean and preprocess it, generating a cleaned database, and (3) analyze and find patterns of the cleaned database, using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.

This repository contains two ipynb files and three csv files.

The two ipynb files are:
1. "a. preprocesamiento.ipynb"  - This code is used to explore, clean and preprocess "bd titanic original.csv", generating the second and third dataset.
2. "b. an√°lisis de datos.ipynb" - This code is used to analyze and find data patterns of "bd titanic mineros 1.csv" and "bd titanic mineros 2.csv".

The three csv files are:
1. "bd titanic original.csv"  - This is the original dataset, extracted from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
2. "bd titanic mineros 1.csv" - This is the cleaned and preprocessed database resulting from "a. preprocesamiento.ipynb".
3. "bd titanic mineros 2.csv" - This is a filtered version of "bd titanic mineros 1.csv", which only includes the records or passengers with an age less or equal than 18 years.
