# titanic-data-analysis
This is a project developed by Mineros DataLab aiming to (1) explore the original database, (2) clean and preprocess it to generate a cleaned database, and (3) analyze and find patterns of the cleaned database, using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.

This repository contains three ipynb files and three csv files.

The three ipynb files are:
1. "a. preprocesamiento.ipynb" - This code is used to explore, clean and preprocess "bd titanic original.csv", generating the second and third dataset.
2. "b. análisis de datos.ipynb" - This code is used to analyze and find data patterns of "bd titanic mineros 1.csv" and "bd titanic mineros 2.csv".
3. "c. análisis de correlación.ipynb" - This code is utilized to find the correlation between different variables and the "Survived" column, which is a good help or guide for the overall analysis of the database.

The three csv files are:
1. "bd titanic original.csv"  - This is the original and initial dataset, extracted from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
2. "bd titanic mineros 1.csv" - This is the cleaned and preprocessed database resulting from "a. preprocesamiento.ipynb".
3. "bd titanic mineros 2.csv" - This is a filtered version of "bd titanic mineros 1.csv", which only includes the records or passengers with an age less or equal than 18 years.
